## What are Templates?

A Template is used to create a Page and defines which components can be used within the selected scope. A template is a hierarchy of nodes that has the same structure as the page to be created, but without any actual content.

Each Template will present you with a selection of components available for use.

* Templates are built up of [Components](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/developing/components.html);

* Components use, and allow access to, Widgets and these are used to render the Content.
